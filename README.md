# Xoriant Assignment - Mobile Automation Framework

This repository contains a mobile automation testing framework built using WebdriverIO, Appium, and Cucumber with JavaScript. The framework is designed to test login functionality of an Android application using the Page Object Model (POM) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles.


## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (v8 or above)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Appium](http://appium.io/)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soumyajit0905/xoriant_assignment.git
   cd xoriant_assignment/wdio-appium
   
Install dependencies:

Ensure that you have npm or yarn installed, then run:
npm install

Configure the Android Emulator:

Make sure you have an Android emulator set up and running. You can do this through Android Studioâ€™s AVD Manager.

Run the tests:

Execute the tests using the following command:
npx wdio run wdio.conf.js

This will start Appium, run the test scenarios described in the login.feature file, and generate a report.

Features
Login Functionality Tests: Validates the login functionality with various input scenarios (positive and negative).
Page Object Model: The project follows POM to maintain clean and reusable code.
BDD with Cucumber: The test scenarios are written in Gherkin syntax for readability and collaboration.

Reporting
The test results are generated using Allure Reports. You can view the report by running:
npx allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
npx allure open allure-report

Troubleshooting
Emulator Issues: Ensure that your emulator is properly configured and running. If you encounter issues with the emulator, try restarting it or checking the ADB connection.
Appium Errors: Make sure that Appium is correctly installed and configured. You can verify the installation by running appium-doctor.
